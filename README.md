## Project Overview

For my Turing Module 3 Frontend solo final project I was tasked with coming up with a "very" specific target audience to create an app for. I came up with a target audience of intellectual fox enthusiasts. I chose to create an app that allowed them to create randomly generated fox pictures with inpirational quotes obtained from a list of available API servers. I call this combination of fox pictures and inspirational quotes "Foxy Quotes." Users are able to create Foxy Quotes, save them, and delete them!

## Chosen API Servers
* [RandomFox](https://randomfox.ca/floof/) *Random Fox Pictures*
* [Quotable](https://api.quotable.io/random?tags=inspirational) *Random Ispirational Quotes*

## Goals
* Build a React App using Router, and asynchronous javascript 
* Make successful API calls to chosen servers
* Build out a cleanly designed, intuitive, and accessible frontend
* Thouroughly Test My files

## Technologies And Tools
> * React (With hooks)
> * React Testing (with Jest)
> * Router
> * JavaScript
> * JSX
> * Heroku Deployment
> * git
> * GitHub
> * Terminal
